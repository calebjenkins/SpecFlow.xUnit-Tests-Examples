# SpecFlow.xUnit-Tests-Examples
I have started to learn Integration testing and in that we have Business Readable Automated Test and there is a great feature of specflow . So that I used SpecFlow.xUnit to test the code.
We can use SpecFlow for more readable testing.
Its helpfull for those people who don't know technical language, they can easily understand what is happning after observing SpecFlow.feature file
